  <h1>Array Const </h1>
<pre>In 2015, JS has introduced an important keyword - const.
  It has become a common practice to declare arrays - const.
  Example:
  const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  <hr/>
</pre>
<h2>Const cannot be reassigned.</h2>
<pre>
  An array declared with const cannot be reassigned.
  const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];    // ERROR
</pre>
<h2>Arrays are not constant.</h2>
<pre>The keyword const is a little misleading.
  It does NOT define a constant array.It defines a constant reference to an array.
  Because of this, we can still change the elements of a constant array.
  <SPAN>ELEMENTS CAN BE CHANGED.</SPAN>
  You can change the elements of a constant array. 
  Example:
  // You can create a constant array:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// You can change an element:
cars[0] = "Toyota";

// You can add an element:
cars.push("Audi");
<hr/>
</pre>
<h2>Assigned when declared </h2>
<pre>
  JS  const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:
  Meaning:an array declared with const muct be initialized when it is declared.
  Using const withour initializing the array is a syntax error:
  Example:
  const cars;
cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];   ===>This is wrong, does not work 
</pre>
Arrays with var can be initialized at any time.<br/>
You can even use the array before it is declared.<br/>
Example:<br/>
cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];<br/>
var cars;<br/>

<hr/>

<h2>CONST</h2>
  <pre>
   1.  An array declared with <span class="red">const </span> has <b>Block Scope</b>. 
    An array declared in a block scope is not the same as an array declared outside the block:
    Example:
    const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
<span class="blue">{
  const cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
}</span>
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
  </pre>
  <hr/>
    <h2>VAR </h2>
  <pre>
   2. An array declared with <span class="red"> var </span> does not have a block scope:
    Example:
    var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
// Here cars[0] is "Saab"
<span class="blue">{
  var cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "BMW"];
  // Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
}</span>
// Here cars[0] is "Toyota"
<hr/>
<h2>REDECLARING ARRAYS </h2>
  </pre>
Redeclaring an array declared with VAR is allowed anywhere in a program.
Example:
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
var cars = ["Toyota", "BMW"];  // Allowed
cars = ["Volvo", "Saab"];      // Allowed

Redeclaring or reassigning an array to CONST, is the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed.
Example:
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Allowed
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
{
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
}

Redeclaring or reassigining an existing CONST array, in the same scope, or in the same block, is not allowed.
Example:
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];     // Not allowed
cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];         // Not allowed

{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Not allowed
  var cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Not allowed
  cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];       // Not allowed
}

Redeclaring an array with CONST, in another scope, or in another block, is allowed.
Example:
const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"];   // Allowed
{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
}
{
  const cars = ["Volvo", "BMW"]; // Allowed
}
