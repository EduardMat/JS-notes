    <h1>JS Comments</h1>
    <p>Comments in JS are used to explain a code or an action. For the single line comment, you can used //.<br/>
    For few lines comments, you can use /*.........*/, in between ** you can place your comment.<br/>
Also, the // and /* */ can be used to block a line of code or a block of codes from being executed.This is realy nice, I am glad there is something like this.ðŸ˜€</p>

<script>
        
        //this is how you write a single line comment 
        /* this is for multi line comment */
