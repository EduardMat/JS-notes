     Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
    </pre>
    <h2>Conditional statements</h2>
    <pre>Very often when you write code, you want to perform diffrent actions for different decisions.
      You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.
      In JS you have the following conditional statements:
      1.Use <span class="blue">if</span> to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
      2.Use <span class="blue">else </span> to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
      3.Use <span class="blue">else if </span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.
      4.Use <span class="blue">switch </span> to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed.
      <span class="note">The SWITCH statement is described in the next chapter.</span>
