      <h1>JS notes taken in my way</h1>
      <p>
        I had difficulties trying to learn JS, doing it in a structural, systematic
        way.I felt that I learn bites and pieces, having pieces missing, like in a puzzle.While doing some reaserch and trying to fix an issue with my coding, I have found our the
        way W3School has the JS explained.I liked the way is structured, easy to
        follow and organised.So I decided to take few notes for personal use,
        and to learn by writting, too.

      <p>Bellow will be all the links leading to the each chapter, each link taking care of a JS aspect.</p>

        <h2>Before to start, there are few interesting things about JS, check them out:</h2>
        <p>JS has powerful tools, which could be used even to change the HTML content as in the example bellow, even used straight in the body:</p>
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p id="demo">Java script change of content</p>
        
    <button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"'>Click Me!</button>

      </div>
      <hr>  
      <div>
        <p>JS can change the HTML attribute values:</p>
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        
    <button
    onClick="document.getElementById(`myImage`).src=`./src/pic_bulbon.gif`"        >
Turn on the light
    </button>
    <img id="myImage" src="./src/pic_bulboff.gif" style="width:100px" />

<button
    onClick="document.getElementById(`myImage`).src=`./src/pic_bulboff.gif`"        >
Turn off the light
    </button>
    <hr>
