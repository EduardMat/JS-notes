      <h1>JS notes taken in my way</h1>
      <p>
        I had difficulties trying to learn JS, doing in a structural, systematic
        way.While trying to fix an issue with my coding, I have found our the
        way W3School has JS explained.I liked the way is structured, easy to
        follow and organised.So I decided to take few notes for personal use,
        and to learn by writting, too.

      <p>Bellow will be all the links leading to the each chapter, each link taking care of a JS aspect.</p>
