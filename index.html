      <p>
        I had difficulties trying to learn JS, doing it in a structural,
        systematic way.I felt that I learn bites and pieces, having pieces
        missing, like in a puzzle.While doing some reaserch and trying to fix an
        issue with my coding, I have found our the way W3School has the JS
        explained.I liked the way is structured, easy to follow and organised.So
        I decided to take few notes for personal use, and to learn by writting,
        too.

          Before to start, there are few interesting things about JS, check them
          out:
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Usually, you can inject JS scrips in the head (CDP) or you add them
          just before the /body.However, JS has powerful tools, which could be
          used even to change the HTML content as in the examples bellow, even
          used straight in the body:
        </h3>
        <p class="example">Example:</p>
        <p id="demo">Java script change of content</p>

        <button
          type="button"
          onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"'
        >
          Click Me!
        </button>
      </div>
      <hr />

      <div>
        <h3>JS can change the HTML attribute values:</h3>
        <p class="example">Example:</p>

        <button
          onClick="document.getElementById(`myImage`).src=`./src/pic_bulbon.gif`"
        >
          Turn on the light
        </button>
        <img id="myImage" src="./src/pic_bulboff.gif" style="width: 100px" />

        <button
          onClick="document.getElementById(`myImage`).src=`./src/pic_bulboff.gif`"
        >
          Turn off the light
        </button>
      </div>
      <hr />

      <div>
        <h3>JS can change the style of an element</h3>
        <p class="example">Example:</p>
        <p id="demoTwo">Style change</p>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick="document.getElementById(`demoTwo`).style.fontSize= `55px`"
        >
          Click Me
        </button>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Bellow will be all the links leading to the each chapter, each link
        taking care of a JS aspect.
