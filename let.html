    <h1>JS let</h1>
    <p>
      The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).<br />
      Variables declared with let have Block Scope.<br />
      Variables declared with let must be Declared before use.<br />
      Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope.
    </p>
    <h2>Block scope:</h2>
    <p>
      Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.<br />
      JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.<br />
      ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.<br />
      These two keywords provideed Block Scope in JavaScript:
    </p>
    <p class="red">Example:</p>
    <p>
      {<br />
      let x = 2;<br />
      }<br />
      // x can NOT be used here as is used already inside the block (inside the
      function) <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Global scope</h2>
    <p>
      Wow!I did not know this! => Variables declared with the var always have
      Global Scope.<br />
      Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope:
    </p>
    <p class="example">Example:</p>
    <p>
      {<br />
      var x = 2;<br />
      }<br />
      // x CAN be used here <br />
      Variables declared with <span class="red"> var </span>inside a { } block
      can be accessed from outside the block.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Cannot be Redeclared</h2>
    <p>
      Variable defined with <span class="red">let </span> cannot be
      redeclared.<br />
      You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with
      <span> let </span>.<br />
      With <span class="red"> let </span> you cannot do this: let x = "John
      Doe";<br />
      let x = 0; <br />
      <br />
      Variables defined with <span class="red"> var </span> <b>can </b> be
      redeclared.With <span class="red"> var</span> you can do this:<br />
      var x = "John Doe";<br />

      var x = 0;
    </p>
    <h2>Redeclaring variables</h2>
    <p>
      Although is possible, when using <span class="red"> var</span> to re
      declare variables, can impose issues.Redeclaring a variable inside a block
      will also redeclare the variable outside the block:<br />
      var x = 10;<br />
      // Here x is 10<br />

      { <br />
      var x = 2;<br />
      // Here x is 2<br />
      }<br />

      // Here x is 2<br />
    </p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      var x = 10;
      // Here x is 10

      {
        var x = 2;
        // Here x is 2
      }

      // Here x is 2
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
    </script>
    <p>
      So, when using <span> let </span> can solve this issue.As declaring a
      variable inside a block will not declare the variable outsode the
      block:<br />
      let x = 10;<br />
      // Here x is 10<br />

      {<br />
      let x = 2;<br />
      // Here x is 2<br />
      }<br />

      // Here x is 10<br />
      Redeclaring a variable using <span class="red"> let </span> in other block (in other function) is allowed.
