    <h1>Java Script Statement</h1>
    <div>
      <p>JavaScript is a list of statements to be executed by a computer.</p>

      <p id="demoOne"></p>
      <script>
        let x, y, z; //Statement 1
        x = 5; //Statement 2
        y = 6; //Statement 3
        z = x + y; //Statement 4

        document.getElementById("demoOne").innerHTML =
          "The value of z is" + z + " .";
      </script>

      <p>
        A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be executed by a
        computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a programming language, these programming instructions are called
        <b>statements</b>
      </p>
      <p>A JavaScript program is a list of statements (instructions).</p>

      <h3>JavaScript statements are:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Values=> data stored in a variable or constant, can be primitive (a
          number, string, bolean) and non-primitive (object, functions, arrays).
        </li>
        <li>
          Operators=> are symbols for additions, multiplications, etc (+, *, =)
        </li>
        <li>
          Expressions=> example : 3 + 4 = 7 (3 and 4 are operants, + and = are
          operators and the 7 is the value)
        </li>
        <li>
          Keywords=> are reserved words which cannot be used to indicate
          variables(eg. async, let ).There are 63 pf rezerved words.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comments=> usually starting with "//" is a piece of text within a
          program which is not executed but provide more info about that code
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="example">Example</p>
      <p>
        In HTML, JavaScrip statements(instructions) are executed by the browser.
      </p>
      <p id="demoTwo"></p>
      <script>
        document.getElementById("demoTwo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly";
      </script>

      <h3>Semicolons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>let a, b, c; //declare 3 variables</li>
        <li>a = 5; //assign the value 5 to a</li>
        <li>b = 6; //assign the value 6 to b</li>
        <li>a = a + b; //assign the sum of a and b to c</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
        When separated by semicolons, you are allowed to have multiple
        statements on one line:
      </h3>
      <p class="example">Example</p>
      <p>a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;</p>

      <h3>JavaScript Code Blocks</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside
        curly brackets{...}, with the purpose to be executed together.The blocks
        can be found in JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        function myFunction(){<br />
        documeny.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly";<br />
        document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?"<br />
        }
      </p>

      <h3>Keywords = reserved words</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>var=> declares a variable</li>
        <li>let=> declares a block of variable</li>
        <li>const=> declares a block constant</li>
        <li>
          if=> Marks a block of statements to be executed with a condition
        </li>
        <li>
          switch=> marks a block of statements to be executed in different cases
        </li>
        <li>for=> marks a block of statements to be executed in a loop</li>
        <li>function=> declares a function</li>
        <li>return=> exits a function</li>
        <li>try=> implement erros handling to a block of statements</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
