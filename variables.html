    <h1>JS Variables</h1>
    <p>
      Well, now is now! Everything until now was simple and easy to learn, I
      think from now I will actually start to learn JS ðŸ™‚!
    </p>
    <h2>Variables => are containers for Storing Data</h2>
    <h3>
      Is is good practice to declare variable before using them. JS Variables
      can be declared in 4 ways:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically</li>
      <li>Using <b>var</b></li>
      <li>Using <b>let</b></li>
      <li>Using <b>const</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>See examples bellow:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>x = 5;</li>
      <li>y = 6;</li>
      <li>z = x + y;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In this example, x, y aand z are undeclared, they are automatically
      declared when will be first used.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h3>!!!Did you know?ðŸ¤”</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>var</b> keyword has been used in all JS from 1995 to 2015.</li>
      <li><b>let</b> and <b>const</b> were added to JS in 2015.</li>
      <li>
        <b>var</b> keyword should now be used in code written for older browser.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h3>When to use var, let, or const ?</h3>
    <p>1.Always declares variables</p>
    <p>
      2.Always use <span class="red">const</span> if the value should not be
      changed
    </p>
    <p>
      3.Always should use <span class="red">const </span> if the type should not
      be changed (Arrays and Objects)
    </p>
    <p>
      4.Only use <span class="red">let</span> if you can t use
      <span class="red"> const</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      5.Only use <span class="red">var</span> if you must support old browsers
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>JS Identifiers</h2>
    <p>
      All JS variables must be identified with
      <span class="red">UNIQUE NAMES</span>
    </p>
    <p>The unique names are called identifiers.</p>
    <p>
      Identifiers can be short names (like x, y) or be more descriptive, like
      age, sum, totalVolume.<br />
      The general rules for constructing names are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1.Names can containers letters, digits, underscores, and dollar sign
      </li>
      <li>2.Names must begin with a letter</li>
      <li>3.Names can also begin with $ and _</li>
      <li>4.Names are case sensitive</li>
      <li>5.Reserved words cannot be used as names</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h2>The Assignment Operator</h2>
    <p>
      In JS the equal sign <span class="red">(=)</span> is an assignemnt
      operator,is not equal sign.<br />If equal sign is needed, then you can use
      <span class="red"> = = = </span>.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>JS Data Script Types</h2>
    <p>
      JS variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values line "John Doe".<br />
      In programming, text values are called text string.<br />
      JS can handle many types of data, but for now, we will learn about numbers
      and strings.
    </p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
      const pi = 3.14;
      let person = "John Doe";
      let answer = "Yes I am";

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        pi + "<br/>" + person + "<br/>" + answer;
    </script>
    <hr />
    <h2>Declaring a JS Variable</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a variable in JS , is called declaring a variable.You can use
      <span class="red">var </span> or <span class="red"> let.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="example">Example:</p>
    <p>
      <span class="red">var</span> carName;<br />
      or<br />
      <span class="red">let</span> carName;<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      After the declaration (creation) the variable still has no value(is called
      undefined).<br />To <b>assing</b> a value to the variable, use the equal
      sign:<br />
      carName = <span class="red">"Volvo";</span><br />
      You can also assing a value to the variable when you declare it:<br />
      let carName = <span class="red">"Volvo";</span>
    </p>

    <h3>This is an example of changing the value of a variable:</h3>
    <p class="example">Example:</p>

    <p id="demoThree"></p>
    <script>
      //on this example, is visible just the value, which is in our case "Volvo";
      let carName = "Volvo";
      document.getElementById("demoThree").innerHTML = carName;
    </script>
    <p>
      Finally, I have understood what is this value, and why always we are
      looking for values inside of things when we want to get a result etc.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>One statement (instruction), many variables!</h2>
    <p>
      You can use on statement to declare more than one variable, as long as you
      use comma in between the variables.However, the declaration(creation) can
      span(take) multiple lines.See examples bellow:
    </p>
    <p class="example">Example:</p>
    <p>
      let person = <span class="red">"John Doe"</span>,carName =
      <span class="red">"Volvo"</span>, price = <span class="red">200</span>;
    </p>
    <p>
      let person = <span class="red">"John Doe"</span>,<br />
      carName = <span class="red">"Volvo"</span>,<br />
      price = <span class="red">200</span>;<br />
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Value = undefined</h2>
    <p>
      Really, I have to understand this, once understood, it will be much easier
      when I will work later with functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in computer programs, variables are often declared without a value.The
      value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will
      be provided later like user input.<br />
      A variable declared without a value, will have the value
      <span class="red"> undefined</span>.<br />
      The variable carName will have the value
      <span class="red"> undefined</span> after the execution of this statement:
    </p>
    <p class="example">Example:</p>
    <p>A variable without a value has the value of:</p>
    <p id="demoFour"></p>
    <script>
      let carsName;
      document.getElementById("demoFour").innerHTML = carsName;
      //we will get an "undefined" result, because we have not assinged a value to carsName;
    </script>
    <hr />

    <h2>Re-Declaring JS Variables</h2>
    <p>
      When declaring a JS value using <span class="red"> var</span>, the value
      will be kept and after execution.<br />
      You cannot re- declared an already declared variable using
      <span class="red"> let </span> or <span class="red">const</span>.<br />
      The variable <span class="red"> carNames</span> will still have the value
      "Volvo" after the execution of following statements:<br />
    </p>
    <p id="demoSix"></p>

    <script>
      var carNames = "Volvo";
      var carNames;
      document.getElementById("demoSix").innerHTML = carName;
    </script>
    <hr />

    <h2>JS Arithmetic</h2>
    <p>
      Exactly like in Math, you can do arithmetic using JS variables:<br />
      let x = 5 + 3 +2 ;
      <!-- x = 10 -->
    </p>
    <p class="example">Example:</p>
    <p>The result of adding 5 + 2 + 3 is:</p>
    <p id="demo7"></p>
    <script>
      let x = 5 + 2 + 3;
      document.getElementById("demo7").innerHTML = x;
    </script>
    <hr />
    <h2>JS Dollar sign $</h2>
    <p>
      Since JavaScript treats a dollar sign as a letter, identifiers containing
      $ are valid variable names:
    </p>
    <p class="example">Example:</p>
    <p>
      let $ = "Hello World";<br />
      let $$$ = 2;<br />
      let $myMoney = 5;
    </p>
     <p id="demo8"></p>

<script>
let $$$ = 2;
let $myMoney = 5;
document.getElementById("demo8").innerHTML = $$$ + $myMoney;
</script> 
<hr/>
<h2>JS Underscore _ </h2> 
<p>Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names.<br/>
 let _lastName = "Johnson";<br/>
let _x = 2;<br/>
let _100 = 5;
</p>
<p class="example">Example:</p>
<p id="demo9"></p>

<script>
let _x = 2;
let _100 = 5;

document.getElementById("demo9").innerHTML = _x + _100;
</script>
<hr/>
